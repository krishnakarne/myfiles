1. Overview
The Openshift CI/CD feature in the DevSecOps Control Center is designed to track and manage CI/CD pipelines specific to Openshift clusters. It provides insights into build, deployment, and testing pipelines related to various artifact versions and clusters.

2. Key Features
Openshift Pipeline Table Overview:

The table displays key information about Openshift CI/CD pipelines, including the following columns:
Id, Type, Artifact ID, Artifact Version, Openshift Cluster, Openshift Namespace, Triggered By, Branch, Pipeline Status, Link, and Pipeline Status Message.
Columns Description:

Id: A unique identifier for each pipeline (e.g., 1, 2).
Type: Specifies the type of deployment or artifact (e.g., SBNA or cd).
Artifact ID: The artifact associated with the pipeline (e.g., onehub-common-backend, 1234).
Artifact Version: The version of the artifact being deployed (e.g., 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT).
Openshift Cluster: The Openshift cluster where the deployment is executed (e.g., TestCluster).
Openshift Namespace: The namespace within the cluster (e.g., TestNamespace).
Triggered By: The user or system that triggered the pipeline (e.g., test).
Branch: The branch of the Git repository used in the deployment (e.g., test).
Pipeline Status: Indicates the outcome of the pipeline execution (e.g., SUCCESS).
Link: Provides a link to additional logs or resources related to the pipeline execution.
Pipeline Status Message: A More Details button allows users to dive deeper into the logs and job execution details.
Pipeline Job Details (Expanded View):

Users can expand individual pipelines to view job-level details, such as:
Build, Deploy, Test: These job steps show the status of each phase in the pipeline (e.g., COMPLETED, IN PROGRESS, PENDING).
Search Feature:

A search bar allows users to filter through pipelines by artifact ID, version, or other relevant criteria to locate specific pipeline executions faster.
Pagination:

Similar to the Mulesoft CI/CD module, users can paginate through entries and change the number of entries displayed per page (e.g., 5 items per page).
3. Additional Notes
Openshift Integration:

The module provides insights specifically tailored to Openshift CI/CD pipelines, displaying relevant data like Openshift Cluster and Namespace in addition to the standard pipeline details.
Job Status Tracking:

Detailed tracking of Build, Deploy, and Test job statuses allows users to ensure each phase of the pipeline is executed as expected, and troubleshoot issues as they arise.
Real-time Monitoring:

Just like the Mulesoft module, this module fetches pipeline data in real time, ensuring up-to-date status for each pipeline execution.
Efficient Monitoring and Management:

The ability to quickly navigate through multiple pipelines using the search and pagination features helps DevOps teams efficiently monitor and manage Openshift-related deployments.
