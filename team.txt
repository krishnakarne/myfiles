The Teams Feature fetches data dynamically using GET services, ensuring the information displayed about teams, repositories, and members is always up-to-date.
Efficient Team Management:

The search feature, combined with the ability to view detailed information about each team, allows for efficient team management. Users can quickly locate and manage teams without having to scroll through long lists.
Detailed Team Information:

Clicking on More Details provides a comprehensive view of each team’s repositories and members. This gives users full visibility into who is involved in each team, what repositories they manage, and any open issues or forks associated with those repositories.
Role and Permission Management:

The Members section allows users to view each team member’s role and whether they have site administrator privileges. This feature is crucial for maintaining security and ensuring proper role-based access control within the organization.
Collaborative Tools:

The repository information displayed for each team ensures that users can access the correct repositories directly from the Teams page. This facilitates collaboration and ensures teams can quickly navigate to their repositories for DevSecOps tasks.
Scalable Design:

The pagination feature ensures that the page remains performant even when managing a large number of teams and members, offering a scalable solution for organizations with extensive DevSecOps operations.
